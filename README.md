Through the Raspberry pi,the values of the DHT 11 Sensor is been sent to the IBM Watson Cloud Platform.The values are then taken to the node red and a UI is been created using the node red. Have also created a UI in the IBM watson for the purpose to check wheather the value is been read or not The Location is been tracked using the Webhooks Relay and Owntracks. The GPS value from the mobile phone is sent to the Webhooks Bucket and from there the value is been sent to the node red dashboard. A Geofencing is also been created so that if the package/in case if something goes out of the respected boundry a trigger will be generated.
